These jumps can be a bit tricky at first, especially on stringed instruments like the fiddle and banjo. The best solution is to have both the E and B notes permanently fingered for the first few bars.

They are hard on the ears but not difficult to suss out, their playing tends to be leaden and often they have a music stand and sheets of dots in front of them for a secure hold on that notion of things being cut into stone.  Others tend to pretty much keep to the way they&#039;d learned it, with only few and subtle variations in the repeats, sometimes as little as the direction of the bow or where a breath is taken, and yet ~ they breath life into it and it dances, lifts the spirits.  The possibilities are endless, and I am always interested and fascinated in how things are given that spark of life by others, their take on a tune, thei way with it.  It&#039;s like all the many recipes for Lancashire Hot Pot.  Though there are some I prefer over others, I&#039;m still interested in how others take it, and the stories behind it all.  I love it - those personal touches, rough or polished ~ inherited, personal choice, failing memory or accident.
